# 500 - Step 1: Start a New Pipeline

Pipelines are a collection of one or more stages. They manage and automate builds, testing, deployments, and other important build and release stages.

**NOTE**: Instead of using the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering by Harness, we ill try and use the Harness Community Edition and install it locally (i.e. not in the cloud). For your information, the Continuous Integration (CI) part of teh Harness Suite is also known as **Drone**. Documentation can be found here: https://docs.drone.io/

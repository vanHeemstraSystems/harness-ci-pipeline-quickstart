# 100 - Objectives

You'll learn how to create a CI Pipeline that does the following:

1. Clone a code repo for an app.
2. Use a Kubernetes cluster build farm.
3. Build the code and run unit tests in the build farm.
4. Package the app as a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub.
5. Pull the uploaded image to the build farm as a service dependency.
6. Run an integration test against the app.
